## Important Guidelines Followed

1. **NO TRADING ADVICE:**

   - No strategy recommendations
   - No "buy/sell" suggestions
   - Only display data and information

2. **DISCLAIMERS:**

   - Site footer: "Information platform. Not financial advice."

3. **PERFORMANCE:**
   - WebSocket throttling (500ms - 1s updates)
   - Component lazy loading
   - Efficient re-renders

4. **ERROR HANDLING:**
   - API error states displayed
   - Graceful degradation when database not configured
   - User-friendly error messages

## Build Status
✅ Build passing successfully
✅ All existing tests passing
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ No console errors

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

   - Fetch live event data
   - Store in database

3. **Mobile Optimization:**

   - Optimize touch interactions
   - Responsive layout refinements

4. **Performance Testing:**
   - Load testing with many alerts
   - WebSocket connection stability
   - Memory usage optimization

## Files Created/Modified
